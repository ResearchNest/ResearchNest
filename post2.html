            Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial
            designer, investor, and media proprietor.
          </p>

          <h2>Facts about Steve</h2>

          <p>
            Jobs’s biological parents had one mandate—that Jobs be adopted by
            two college-educated people. The biological parents found out that
            neither Clara nor Paul Jobs had ever graduated from college, but the
            adoption went through when it was promised that Steve Jobs would
            receive a university education (funny considering that Jobs went on
            to become a college dropout).
          </p>

          <p>
            Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak met in high school—Wozniak
            was 18 and Jobs was just 13.
          </p>

          <p>
            While unofficially attending classes, Jobs struggled to get by. He
            slept on his friends’ dorm room floors, returned Coke bottles for
            money, and survived off free meals from the local Hare Krishna
            temple.
          </p>

          <p>
            He spent seven months traveling around India, experimenting with
            psychedelic drugs and eventually adopting the practices of Zen
            Buddhism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jobs stole from partner and co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak. When
            the pair first created the Breakout game for Atari, they planned on
            splitting the pay 50-50. Although Atari gave Jobs $5,000 for the
            game, Jobs told Wozniak they got $700, leaving Wozniak to take home
            $350 while Jobs pocketed the other $4,650.
          </p>

          <p>
            here was actually a third founder of Apple—Ronald Wayne, who even
            designed Apple’s first logo. Wayne sold his 10 percent stake just
            two weeks after partnering with Jobs and Wozniak for only $800 (talk
            about regrets).
          </p>
          <p>
            The original Apple I computer was priced at $666.66. Don’t worry,
            there was no devil worshipping going on—Jobs and Wozniak just wanted
            the Apple I to cost one-third more than wholesale ($500).
          </p>
          <p>
            Jobs was pushed out of his own company in 1985. Despite the fallout,
            he later recognized the coup as a blessing in disguise, as it gave
            him a chance to experiment creatively and purchase an animation
            studio, which would later be known as Pixar. Eventually he rejoined
            Apple as CEO in 1997 (and revitalized the failing company).
